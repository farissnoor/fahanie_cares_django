## How to Use

### For New Member Registration:
1. Create a URL pattern pointing to `FahanieCaresMemberRegistrationView`
2. Users can register at `/register/` (or your chosen URL)
3. Staff can approve members through Django admin

### For Staff/Admin:
1. Access Django admin at `/admin/`
2. Navigate to "Constituents" → "#FahanieCares Members"
3. View, filter, search, and approve members
4. Use bulk actions to approve multiple members at once

### Next Steps:
1. Add URL patterns in `apps/constituents/urls.py`:
```python
from .member_views import (
    FahanieCaresMemberRegistrationView, 
    RegistrationSuccessView,
    MemberProfileView,
    MemberUpdateView,
    MemberListView
)

urlpatterns = [
    # ... existing patterns ...
    path('register/', FahanieCaresMemberRegistrationView.as_view(), name='member_register'),
    path('register/success/', RegistrationSuccessView.as_view(), name='registration_success'),
    path('profile/', MemberProfileView.as_view(), name='member_profile'),
    path('profile/update/', MemberUpdateView.as_view(), name='member_update'),
    path('staff/members/', MemberListView.as_view(), name='staff_member_list'),
]
```

2. Create success page template at `templates/constituents/registration_success.html`
3. Add member profile and update templates as needed
4. Test the registration flow

## Important Notes
